### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm Ji Chenqing, a senior undergraduate student from department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering in SUSTech. Here, I hope to record all my experiences in the last semester year.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Anticancer drug detection research.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Software Defined Radio and C++.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mmwave integration sensing in communication.
- ðŸ’¬ You can discuss with me about all the problems in the course CS305(Computer Networking).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 11911303@mail.sustech.edu.cn

### I know that it is difficult to upload folders and code projects directly on Github, so I have another .md file in this repository that details common operations for using git to manage code uploads in VScode.
