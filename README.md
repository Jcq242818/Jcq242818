### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Ji Chenqing, a senior undergraduate student from department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering in SUSTech. At the end of this semester, I will continue to embark on my postgraduate life here. My research interest is related to many aspects of wireless network, especially the integration between sensing and communication (ISAC).

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Wi-Fi and mmwave (60GHz) sensing in ISAC (IEEE 802.11bf).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 12332152@mail.sustech.edu.cn

### I know that it is difficult to upload folders and code projects directly on Github, so I have another .md file in this repository that details common operations for using git to manage code uploads in VScode.
