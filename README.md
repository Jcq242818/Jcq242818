### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### I'm Ji Chenqing, a senior undergraduate student from department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering in SUSTech. Here, I hope to record all my experiences in the last semester year.

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on mmwave integration sensing in communication.
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 11911303@mail.sustech.edu.cn

### I know that it is difficult to upload folders and code projects directly on Github, so I have another .md file in this repository that details common operations for using git to manage code uploads in VScode.
