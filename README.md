### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm Ji Chenqing, a first-year graduate student from department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering (EEE) in SUSTech. My research interest is related to many aspects of wireless network and mobile computing, especially **I**ntegrated **S**ensing **A**nd **C**ommunication (ISAC).

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Wi-Fi and mmwave (60GHz) sensing in ISAC (IEEE 802.11bf).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 12332152@mail.sustech.edu.cn

#### I know that it is difficult to upload folders and code projects directly on GitHub, so I have another .md file in this repository that details common operations for using git to manage code uploads in VScode.
