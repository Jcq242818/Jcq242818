### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
#### I'm Ji Chenqing, a postgraduate student from the Department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering (EEE) in SUSTech. My research interest is related to many aspects of wireless network and mobile computing, especially **I**ntegrated **S**ensing **A**nd **C**ommunication (ISAC, e.g. IEEE 802.11 bf).

- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on channel modeling based on the physical layer which will assist many application layer tasks of ISAC (e.g. Localization, Tracking, and Imaging) in WiFi (2.4/5GHz, IEEE 802.11 b/g/n/ax) or mmWave (60GHz, IEEE 802.11 ad/ay).
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: 12332152@mail.sustech.edu.cn

#### I know that it is difficult to upload folders and code projects directly on GitHub, so I have another .md file in this repository that details common operations for using git to manage code uploads in VScode.
