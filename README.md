### Hi there 👋
### I'm Ji Chenqing, a senior undergraduate student from department of Electronic and Electrical Engineering in SUSTech. At the end of this semester, I will continue to embark on my postgraduate life here. My research interest is related to many aspects of wireless networks, especially the integration between sensing and communication (ISAC).

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on mmwave integration sensing in communication.
- 📫 How to reach me: 11911303@mail.sustech.edu.cn

### I know that it is difficult to upload folders and code projects directly on Github, so I have another .md file in this repository that details common operations for using git to manage code uploads in VScode.
